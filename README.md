# CS5️⃣0️⃣

This repository serves as a compilation of the solutions I've submitted for Harvard's CS50 series of courses. Of the courses, I've attempted CS50x and CS50 Python.

## CS50x

CS50x is Harvard's original course and teaches basic programming fundamentals using C.

I recall very vividly the time when I watched the first lecture of this course, at a time when I had been learning Javascript for a month or 2. I came away all **smiles** and SO excited to learn more about programming. David Malan explained the simple fundamentals of bits and bytes so clearly that I could understand it immediately. What once seemed arcane and beyond the realm of my perception was suddenly so simple and relatable. I remember still, how happy I felt; oh jubilee!

I watched the first 3 weeks worth of lectures, and resumed my studies in Javascript. I was happy, but I wanted to focus and not be derailed. 2 months later, I would join [42's Piscine](https://github.com/felixtanhm/42-piscine), where I would once again be reacquainted with the C language.

Post Piscine, I came back to CS50x again. Continuing on with the fourth lecture in the series, I was once again mindblown. I was once again taken on a journey where curtains were drawn back and understanding was unveiled. Going through the Piscine at 42, I learnt of memory and it's allocation. I learnt of files and manipulation of it's contents. It took 2 weeks, and at the end of it, I was still not completely sure I understood it's concepts.

Watching `Week4` of CS50x, in 2 hours, gave me a more thorough understanding of these concepts than the Piscine could. I feel the same sense of happiness and excitement once again. This experience has taught me just how important the ability to teach and explain something is; and such a rare skillset it is.
